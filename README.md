# ps4-controller-weak-auth
WEAK_AUTH algorithm of Pla\*\*\*\*tion4 controller. Please **don't use it**, or $\*\*ï¿¥ may kill you, even though they are busy working on Pla\*\*\*\*tion5 now.

This is for educational only, all the related data can be found in public internet.

## You are **not expected to understand this** unless you have deeply reverse engineered the Pla****tion4 controller. ðŸ˜ˆ

All publicly available researches on the ps4 controller authentication protocol on the Internet are aimed at the main authentication (256 Bytes challenge, 1040 Bytes response) in the case of USB, except this one. This research reveals the WEAK_AUTH algorithm when the PS4 controller is connected using the Bluetooth protocol, which will be once every 4 seconds. Failing them seems to cause the PS4 to immediately ignore the controller.

```
input:
    [NOUSE, 1B] + [tid, 1B] + [input challenge, 32B], total_len = 34B

dword_20023B68:
    [v2 ^ sub_14836(), 4B]+[HIDWORD(v1) ^ v5[1], 4B] + [byte_1FFE0290, 64B] + [dword_1FFE0114, 4B] + [dword_1FFE00C8,4B], total_len = 80B

dword_20023AEA:
    [table[tid],32B] + [input[2:34],32B] + [sha1(dword_20023B68), 20B], total_len = 84B

output:
    [input[0:2], 2B] + [sha1(dword_20023AEA), 20B] + [sha1(dword_20023B68), 20B], total_len = 42B
```

As you can see, the secret here only depends on the lookup table, which is the same in all controllers. You should know how to get a copy of the controller's firmware.

You can test it with the following input&output example:

```
